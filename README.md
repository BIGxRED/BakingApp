# BakingApp

This is an app that was developed as a part of the [Udacity Android Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) program. The primary purpose of this app is to display different baking recipes to the end user and show them how to make the recipes. It includes features such as:

- Media loading by using ExoPlayer to show the user a video for each step of the recipe
- A complete UX through grocery list widget to show the user all of the necessary ingredients for a recipe
- Unique layouts for both tablets and handheld devices through the use of Java, fragments, and XML
- Integrated third-party libraries including Butterknife, Retrofit, Picasso, and ExoPlayer
- Verified user interfaces through intensive UI testing via Espresso
